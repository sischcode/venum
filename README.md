# About venum

Venum is a small crate, that is essentially just one enum type that can be used for 'dynamic typing'. It's much like serde's Value enum for example, but with lots of functions to parse and convert between enum variants.

## WARNING

This is **_nowhere_** near production ready code! Only use for testing and or (self-) education, at this point!
